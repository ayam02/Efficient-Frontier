        "First proposed by economist Harry Markowitz in 1952, Modern Portfolio Theory holds that a given investment's risk and return characteristics should not be viewed in isolation; rather, it should be judged according to how it affects the overall portfolio's risk and return. By optimizing the mix of investments we can do either of the following:\n",

        "* Maximize the return associated with a given level of risk\n",
